# niLookAtController

Orients an axis of the controlled object towards a lookAt target. The axis is selectable.

Warning: The lookAt property is not reference counted, so this controller must be removed, or lookAt set to nil before the lookAt object is deleted.

This type inherits the following: [niTimeController](../../types/niTimeController), [niObject](../../types/niObject)
## Properties

### `active`

If the controller is active. When inactive, the target does not get updated and animation timing does not advance.

**Returns**:

* `result` (boolean)

***

### `animTimingType`

How the time parameter passed to the update function is treated. Type 0 is the default, which treats the update time as a delta time. Type 1 treats the update time an offset from the start of the animation.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `axis`

A number representing the axis that points at the lookAt object. `flip` determines which end of this axis points at the target.
`0` X axis
`1` Y axis
`2` Z axis

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `cycleType`

The animation cycle type. Type 0 is looping, type 2 is reverse, type 4 is clamped.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `flip`

Determines which end of the chosen axis points towards the lookAt target.

**Returns**:

* `result` (boolean)

***

### `frequency`

The animation controller's frequency value. It is a scaling value used to convert from update time units to keyframe time units, if necessary.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `highKeyFrame`

This is the end animation key time of the animation controller.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `lastScaledTime`

This function returns the last scaled time computed by this controller. The scaled time takes the `frequency` and `phase` into account, along with the `cycleType` and `animTimingType`. This is the last value used to interpolate animation keys.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `lastTime`

No description.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `lookAt`

The object that this controller will point towards. This is not a reference counted pointer, so this controller must be removed or lookAt set to nil before the lookAt object is deleted. This was probably designed to avoid reference cycles where controllers keep an ancestor node alive.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([niAVObject](../../types/niAVObject))

***

### `lowKeyFrame`

This is the beginning animation key time of the animation controller.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `nextController`

The next animation controller in the list of controllers containing the calling controller.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([niTimeController](../../types/niTimeController))

***

### `phase`

The phase value. It is an offset applied to the animation's update time, in seconds.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `refCount`

*Read-only*. The number of references that exist for this object. When this value reaches zero, the object will be deleted.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `RTTI`

*Read-only*. The runtime type information for this object. This is an alias for the `.runTimeTypeInformation` property.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([niRTTI](../../types/niRTTI))

***

### `runTimeTypeInformation`

*Read-only*. The runtime type information for this object.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([niRTTI](../../types/niRTTI))

***

### `startTime`

The time at which the animation controller starts playing its animation.

**Returns**:

* `result` (number)

***

### `target`

*Read-only*. The scene graph object that this animation controller is to animate.

**Returns**:

* `result` ([niObjectNET](../../types/niObjectNET))

***

## Methods

### `clone`

Creates a copy of this object.

```lua
local result = myObject:clone()
```

**Returns**:

* `result` ([niObject](../../types/niObject))

***

### `isInstanceOfType`

Determines if the object is of a given type, or of a type derived from the given type. Types can be found in the [`ni.type`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/ni/types/) table.

```lua
local result = myObject:isInstanceOfType(type)
```

**Parameters**:

* `type` (number): Use values in the [`ni.type`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/ni/types/) table.

**Returns**:

* `result` (boolean)

***

### `isOfType`

Determines if the object is of a given type. Types can be found in the [`ni.type`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/ni/types/) table.

```lua
local result = myObject:isOfType(type)
```

**Parameters**:

* `type` (number): Use values in the [`ni.type`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/ni/types/) table.

**Returns**:

* `result` (boolean)

***

### `saveBinary`

Serializes the object, and writes it to the given file.

```lua
local success = myObject:saveBinary(path)
```

**Parameters**:

* `path` (string): The path to write the file at, relative to the Morrowind installation folder.

**Returns**:

* `success` (boolean): If true the object was successfully serialized.

***

### `setTarget`

This method assigns a new target to the animation controller.

```lua
myObject:setTarget(target)
```

**Parameters**:

* `target` ([niObjectNET](../../types/niObjectNET)): The new target to assign.

***

### `start`

Starts the controller at the specified time. Intended for controllers with `animTimingType` of 1.

```lua
myObject:start(time)
```

**Parameters**:

* `time` (number)

***

### `stop`

Stops the controller. If you only want to pause the controller, use the `update` property.

```lua
myObject:stop()
```
