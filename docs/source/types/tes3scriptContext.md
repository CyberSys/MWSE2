A script context object, which allows variables to be get/set using the variable name.

## Methods

### `getVariableData`
<div class="search_terms" style="display: none">getvariabledata, variabledata</div>

This method fetches all of the script's variables as a table.

```lua
local results = myObject:getVariableData()
```

**Returns**:

Each entry has following fields:

 1. type  - `s`, `f` or `l`, which stand for `short`, `float`, and `long`
 2. index - the order of occurance of the variable in the script, starting from `0`
 3. value - this can have `nil` value

??? example "Example: An example of indexing local script variables inside `tes3scriptContext` objects"

	Companions usually have a mwscript script with variable named `companion` set to 1. This can be used to determine if a reference is player's companion or not.

	```lua
	--- This function returns `true` if the reference
	--- has a variable companion set to 1 in its script.
	---@param reference tes3reference
	---@return boolean
	local function hasCompanionShare(reference)
	
		-- This shows that we can read any variable inside
		-- `tes3scriptContext` objects as if it was normal Lua table
		-- (`reference.context` is of `tes3scriptContext` type)
		local companion = reference.context["companion"]
		return (companion and
				companion == 1 or
				false
		)
	end

	```
