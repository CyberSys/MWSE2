# Reference Functions

--8<-- "mwse-deprecated.md"


## `xAddItem`

**Parameters:**

- `string` **objectID**: The object ID of the item to add.
- `long` **count**: The number of items to add.

**Returned:**

- *None*

This is a wrapper for the vanilla AddItem function that can take variable input.


***

## `xDistance`

**Parameters:**

- `reference` **target**: The reference of the target to get the distance from.

**Returned:**

- `float` **distance**: The distance between the calling reference and the **target** reference.

Calculates the distance between the calling reference and **target**.

!!! note
	Unlike the vanilla `GetDistance` function, this function will work on non-actors.

??? example "Distance from PC Target"
	This example calculates the distance between the PC and what they are looking at.

	```
	begin DistanceToTarget

	long pcRef
	long targetRef
	float distance

	setx pcRef to xGetRef "player"
	setx targetRef to xGetPCTarget

	setx distance to pcRef->xDistance targetRef

	end
	```


***

## `xExplodeSpell`

**Parameters:**

- `string` **objectID**: The object ID of the spell to explode.

**Returned:**

- *None*

This is a wrapper for the vanilla ExplodeSpell function that can take variable input.


***

## `xGetBaseID`

**Parameters:**

- *None*

**Returned:**

- `string` **id**: The reference's base object ID.

`xGetBaseID` returns reference's base object ID. In contrast to `xRefID`, this function will not include the hexadecimal suffix that identifies unique instances of containers, creatures, or NPCs. For example, where `xRefID` would return `"Fargoth00000000"`, `xGetBaseID` would instead return just `"Fargoth"`.


***

## `xGetCharge`

**Parameters:**

- *None*

**Returned:**

- `float` **charge**: The current charge on a item.

Returns the current charge on a 'cast when used' or 'cast when strikes' enchanted item. Constant effect and non-enchanted items return `0`.


***

## `xGetCondition`

**Parameters:**

- *None*

**Returned:**

- `float` **condition**: The current condition on a item.

Returns the current condition for armor and weapons and remaining uses for lockpicks, probes, and repair tools.


***

## `xGetEnchant`

**Parameters:**

- *None*

**Returned:**

- `string` **enchantID**: The Object ID of the enchantment.
- `short` **type**: The type of the enchantment. `0` = Cast Once, `1` = Cast on Strike, `2` = Cast on Use, `3` = Constant
- `short` **cost**: The cost of the enchantment.
- `float` **currentCharge**: The current charge for the enchantment.
- `long` **maxCharge**: The maximum charge for the enchantment.
- `short` **numEffect**: The number of effects on the enchantment.
- `long` **autocalc**: 1 if the enchantment is auto-calculated.

Returns info about the enchantment on the target item, or 0 if no enchantment is present.


***

## `xGetEncumb`

**Parameters:**

- *None*

**Returned:**

- `float` **weight**: The weight, in pounds, of all the reference's inventory. This value is negative if leveled items are present.

Calculates the total, unmodified encumbrance of the target reference's inventory. This function does not take into account any *feather* or *burden* spell effects.

!!! note
	If the target has any leveled items in its inventory, the returned **weight** is negative.


***

## `xGetItemCount`

**Parameters:**

- `string` **objectId**: The item's object ID to get the count of.

**Returned:**

- `long` **itemCount**: The number of items that the reference has.

This is a wrapper function around `GetItemCount` that allows variable input.


??? example
	```
	begin Example_xGetItemCount

	long ref

	long id
	long count

	setx ref to xGetRef "player"

	setx id to xStringBuild "Gold_001"

	setx count to ref->xGetItemCount id

	MessageBox "Total Gold: %g" count

	StopScript Example_xGetItemCount

	end
	```


***

## `xGetLockLevel`

**Parameters:**

- **None**

**Returned:**

- `short` **lockLevel**: The reference's lock level, or -1 if none was found.

Returns the lock level of a door or container. This function returns -1 for doors/containers that have never been locked and for items that aren't doors or containers.

This returns the lock level regardless of whether the item is locked or unlocked. Use GetLocked to determine the state of the lock.

Lock level is stored as a signed short (16 bits, max value = 32,767). Values less than 0 do not survive saving, exiting, and reloading. They are converted to their absolute value and the door/container is flagged as unlocked.


***

## `xGetMaxCharge`

**Parameters:**

- *None*

**Returned:**

- `float` **maxCharge**: The current charge on a item.

Returns the maximum charge on an enchanted item.


***

## `xGetMaxCondition`

**Parameters:**

- *None*

**Returned:**

- `float` **maxCondition**: The current maximum condition on a item.

Returns the maxium condition for armor and weapons and maximum uses for lockpicks, probes, and repair tools.


***

## `xGetModel`

**Parameters:**

- `string` **objectId**: The object ID to get the model of. If 0, the reference will be used.

**Returned:**

- `string` **modelPath**: The path to the model.

This function returns the model of an object. This can be done by passing a string for the object Id, or 0 can be passed to use the script's reference.

!!! note
	The path returned does not include the *Data Files\\models* prefix.

??? example "Get Model by Object ID"
	```
	begin Example_xGetModelById

	long model

	setx model to xGetModel "ingred_bonemeal_01"
	if ( model == 0 )
		return
	endif

	xMessageFix "Model: %s" model
	MessageBox "Model: ________________________________"

	end
	```

??? example "Get Model by Reference"
	```
	begin Example_xGetModelByRef

	long ref
	long model

	setx ref to xGetPCTarget
	if ( ref == 0 )
		return
	endif

	setx model to ref->xGetModel 0
	if ( model == 0 )
		return
	endif

	xMessageFix "Model: %s" model
	MessageBox "Model: ________________________________"

	end
	```


***

## `xGetName`

**Parameters:**

- *None*

**Returned:**

- `string` **name**: The reference's name, or `0` if no name was found.

`xGetName` returns a string containing the name (suitable for display, not the objectid) for the object or 0 if the object doesn't have a name. The NPC who falls from the sky near Seyda Neen has an object id of "agronian guy" but his name is "Tarhiel" when you look at his corpse.


***

## `xGetOwnerInfo`

**Parameters:**

- *None*

**Returned:**

- `string` **owner**: The object ID of the NPC or faction owner of the object.
- `long` or `string` **condition**: If owned by a faction, this is a `long` indicating the required rank. If this is an NPC this value is either 0, or a `string` for the global variable to check.
- `long` **type**: The Object Type of **owner**, either NPC or Faction.

Ownership of entities in the world in Morrowind is comprised of two parts: **owner** and **condition** (this can specify when the player being detected taking or using the entity is not considered a crime). These work in two modes:

1. The first is where **owner** is an NPC ID, and **condition** is a global variable - while the global var is set to a non-zero value, activating the entity is never considered a crime.
1. In the second mode, **owner** is a faction id, and **condition** is a rank within it. If the player has equal (or higher) rank in that faction, then he can be seen using or taking the entity without it being a crime. This is how supply chests and beds in guildhalls work (their rank requirement is the minimal rank).

This function allows getting full ownership information of an entity: both parts, whatever they may be (as well as what mode is used for the ownership). It is more in-depth than the `xGetOwner` function, which does not fully handle faction ownership or ownership with a global var requirement.

!!! tip
	If the returned **condition** is a global variable, it can be used with `xGetGlobal` and `xSetGlobal`.


??? example "Boobytrapped Mages Guild and Telvanni faction containers"
	```
	begin boobycontainers
	;if the player tries to open a container owned by either MG or GHT that he
	;doesn't have the required rank to legally take items from, then instead of
	;the container opening, the player will be zapped.

## `xRefID`

**Parameters:**

- *None*

**Returned:**

- `string` **id**: The reference's ID.

`xRefID` returns the reference's ID. In contrast to `xGetBaseID`, this function will include the hexadecimal suffix that identifies unique instances of containers, creatures, or NPCs. For example, where `xRefID` would return `"Fargoth00000000"`, `xGetBaseID` would instead return just `"Fargoth"`.


***

## `xRefType`

***

## `xSetMaxCharge`

**Parameters:**

- `float` **maxCharge**: New charge that will be set on the reference.

**Returned:**

- `long` **result**: 1 if the reference's was modified, otherwise 0.

Sets the maximum charge on an enchanted item.


***

## `xSetMaxCondition`

**Parameters:**

- `float` **maxCondition**: New maximum condition that will be set on the reference.

**Returned:**

- `long` **result**: 1 if the reference's was modified, otherwise 0.

Sets the maxium condition for armor and weapons and maximum uses for lockpicks, probes, and repair tools.


***

## `xSetName`

**Parameters:**

- `string` **name**:  The new name to apply to the reference's base object. (Maximum 31 characters)

***

## `xSetTrap`

**Parameters:**

- `string` **spellID** : The spell ID to set as the trap, or `0` to unset a trap.

**Returned:**

- `short` **result**: `1` if the reference's trap was modified, otherwise `0`.

Sets a trap. Only works on containers or doors. In order to have a trap, a reference must also have a lock. For references without locks, call `Lock 0` and `Unlock` prior to `xSetTrap`.

Traps that are set this way do not persist through saving and loading. If a trap is removed its removal persists only if the object is activated or its lock is manipulated before saving.

If you want to set a trap on a door/container, first check for an existing lock (`xGetLockLevel`). If no lock is already installed, use `Lock 0`, `Unlock` to create the lock/trap object. Set the trap. To make sure the trap is persistent, manipulate the lock, but then put it back to its original state. In other words, if the lock is currently unlocked, lock it (use `xGetLockLevel` to determine the correct lock level) then unlock it. Do the reverse if it's currently unlocked.


***

## `xSetValue`

**Parameters:**

- `long` **value**: New value that will be set on the reference's base object.

**Returned:**

- `long` **result**: 1 if the reference's base object was modified, otherwise 0.

`xSetValue` modifies the value of reference's base object.


***

## `xSetWeight`

**Parameters:**

- `float` **weight**: New weight that will be set on the reference's base object.

**Returned:**

- `long` **result**: 1 if the reference's base object was modified, otherwise 0.

`xSetWeight` modifies the weight of the reference's base object.
