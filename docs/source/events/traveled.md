# traveled

This event fires once the player arrives at a travel destination via a travel service.

```lua
--- @param e traveledEventData
local function traveledCallback(e)
end
event.register(tes3.event.traveled, traveledCallback)
```

!!! tip
	This event can be filtered based on the **`cell`** event data.

!!! tip
	An event can be claimed by setting `e.claim` to `true`, or by returning `false` from the callback. Claiming the event prevents any lower priority callbacks from being called.

## Event Data

* `basePrice` (number): *Read-only*. The base cost of traveling the service.
* `cell` ([tes3cell](../../types/tes3cell)): *Read-only*. The destination cell of the travel.
* `companions` ([tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor)[], nil): *Read-only*. Companions that have traveled with the player, or `nil` if no companions were present.
* `destination` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference)): *Read-only*. The travel marker that marks the destination at which the player arrived at.
* `hoursPassed` (number): *Read-only*. The time passed during travel, in in-game hours.
* `mobile` ([tes3mobileActor](../../types/tes3mobileActor)): *Read-only*. The mobile actor of the merchant that transported the player.
* `previousCell` ([tes3cell](../../types/tes3cell)): *Read-only*. The starting cell of the travel.
* `price` (number): *Read-only*. The actual cost of the service.
* `reference` ([tes3reference](../../types/tes3reference)): *Read-only*. The mobileâ€™s related reference.

## Examples

!!! example "Example: A travel accident"

	The player may have an accident during a trip from Balmora to Suran via a Silt Strider.

	```lua
	
	-- The first line here tells our Lua plugin what type the `e` parameter is.
	-- When the type is known, it can provide autocomplete suggestions, making
	-- it easier to work with.
	---@param e traveledEventData
	local function onTraveled(e)
		-- :lower() is a method on the string object type.
		-- It makes the string lowercase.
		if e.previousCell.id:lower() == "balmora" and e.cell.id:lower() == "suran" then
	
			-- math.random generates a random number from range [1, 100]
			-- If the rolled value is bigger than 50 we execute our logic,
			-- which means there is 50 % chance that our accident will happen.
			local roll = math.random(100)
			if roll > 50 then
				-- The player fell of the Silt strider!
	
				-- This function teleports the player to the specified position.
				-- It's used here to imitate the player falling from the Silt strider.
				tes3.positionCell({
					reference = tes3.player,
					position = { 25112, -34879, 600 }, -- This is a point on the coast of Lake Amaya.
					teleportCompanions = true,
				})
				tes3.messageBox("You fell out during your travel!")
			end
		end
	end
	
	event.register(tes3.event.traveled, onTraveled)

	```
