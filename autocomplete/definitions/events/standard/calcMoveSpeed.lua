- Walking: [calcWalkSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcWalkSpeed) -> **calcMoveSpeed**
- Running: [calcWalkSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcWalkSpeed) -> [calcRunSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcRunSpeed) -> **calcMoveSpeed**
- Swimming: [calcWalkSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcWalkSpeed) -> [calcSwimSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcSwimSpeed) -> **calcMoveSpeed**
- Swimming (while running): [calcWalkSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcWalkSpeed) -> [calcSwimSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcSwimSpeed) -> [calcSwimRunSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcSwimRunSpeed) -> **calcMoveSpeed**
- Flying: [calcFlySpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcFlySpeed) -> **calcMoveSpeed**]],
