- Walking: **calcWalkSpeed** -> [calcMoveSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcMoveSpeed)
- Running: **calcWalkSpeed** -> [calcRunSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcRunSpeed) -> [calcMoveSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcMoveSpeed)
- Swimming: **calcWalkSpeed** -> [calcSwimSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcSwimSpeed) -> [calcMoveSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcMoveSpeed)
- Swimming (while running): **calcWalkSpeed** -> [calcSwimSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcSwimSpeed) -> [calcSwimRunSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcSwimRunSpeed) -> [calcMoveSpeed](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/events/calcMoveSpeed)]],
