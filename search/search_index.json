Functions \u2693\ufe0e lfs.attributes \u2693\ufe0e Returns a table with the file attributes corresponding to filepath (or nil followed by an error message and a system-dependent error code in case of error). If the second optional argument is given and is a string, then only the value of the named attribute is returned (this use is equivalent to lfs.attributes(filepath)[request_name], but the table is not created and only one attribute is retrieved from the O.S.). if a table is passed as the second argument, it (result_table) is filled with attributes and returned instead of a new table. The attributes are described as follows; attribute mode is a string, all the others are numbers, and the time related attributes use the same time reference of os.time: dev, mode, nlink, access, modification, change, size, permissions. local attributes , error = lfs . attributes ( path , request , resultTable ) Parameters : path (string): The path, relative to the current directory, to get attributes for. request (string): Optional . The specific attribute to look for. If provided, the return value becomes the requested value (or nil) instead of a table. resultTable (table): Optional . If provided, this table will be reused as the result table. If not provided, a new table is created. Returns : attributes (table, string, number, nil): All attributes in a table, the value of a specific attribute if one was requested, or nil on an error. error (string, nil): In the case of an error, a string describing the issue. lfs.chdir \u2693\ufe0e Changes the current working directory to the given path. Note that this is global. Do not use this function without restoring the previous directory at the end of your logic. Failure to do so can cause unrecoverable errors. local success , error = lfs . chdir ( path ) Parameters : path (string): The path to change to. Returns : success (boolean, nil): true in case of success, or nil on an error. error (string, nil): In the case of an error, a string describing the issue. lfs.currentdir \u2693\ufe0e Changes the current working directory to the given path. local path , error = lfs . currentdir () Returns : path (string, nil): The current working directory, or nil on an error. error (string, nil): In the case of an error, a string describing the issue. lfs.dir \u2693\ufe0e Creates a Lua iterator over the entries of a given directory. This can be used to create a for loop of directories. Be wary that current and parent directory markers may be available in the results. lfs . dir ( path ) Parameters : path (string): The path to iterate over. lfs.directoryexists \u2693\ufe0e Simple check to determine if a directory exists. local success = lfs . directoryexists ( path ) Parameters : path (string): The path to determine existance of. Returns : success (boolean): true if the directory exists. lfs.fileexists \u2693\ufe0e Simple check to determine if a file exists. local success = lfs . fileexists ( path ) Parameters : path (string): The path to determine existance of. Returns : success (boolean): true if the file exists. lfs.link \u2693\ufe0e Creates a link. This is a hard link by default. local success , error = lfs . link ( old , new , symlink ) Parameters : old (string): The object to link to. new (string): The name of the link. symlink (boolean): Optional . If true, the link will be symbolic instead. Returns : success (boolean, nil): true in case of success, or nil on an error. error (string, nil): In the case of an error, a string describing the issue. lfs.lock \u2693\ufe0e Locks a file or a part of it. This function works on open files; the file handle should be specified as the first argument. local success , error = lfs . lock ( filehandle , mode , start , length ) Parameters : filehandle ( ioFile ): The file handle to lock. mode (string): \"r\" for a read/shared lock, or \"w\" for a write/exclusive lock. start (number): Optional . The starting point of the file to lock. length (number): Optional . The length of the file, relative to start, to lock. Returns : success (boolean, nil): true if the operation was successful, or nil in the case of an error. error (string, nil): In the case of an error, a string describing the issue. In particular, if the lock exists and is not stale it returns the \"File exists\" message. lfs.lock_dir \u2693\ufe0e Creates a lockfile (called lockfile.lfs) in path if it does not exist and returns the lock. If the lock already exists checks if it's stale, using the second parameter (default for the second parameter is INT_MAX, which in practice means the lock will never be stale.

In the case of an error, a string describing the issue. lfs.touch \u2693\ufe0e Set access and modification times of a file. Both access and modified times are measured in seconds, matching the OS time function. local success , error = lfs . touch ( path , accessTime , modifiedTime ) Parameters : path (string): The path to touch. accessTime (number): Optional . The new access time to set. modifiedTime (number): Optional . The new last modified time to set Returns : success (boolean, nil): true in case of success, or nil on an error. error (string, nil): In the case of an error, a string describing the issue. lfs.unlock \u2693\ufe0e Unlocks a file or a part of it.

Please review the complete documentation (with in-depth discussion and many examples) at: http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/ There is also a copy in the MWSE repo at: deps/lpeg/lpeg.html Functions \u2693\ufe0e lpeg.B \u2693\ufe0e Returns a pattern that matches only if the input string at the current position is preceded by pattern p. Pattern p must match only strings with some fixed length, and it cannot contain captures. Like the and predicate, this pattern never consumes any input, independently of success or failure. local result = lpeg . B ( p ) Parameters : p (pattern): The input pattern. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.C \u2693\ufe0e Create a simple capture pattern, which captures the substring of the subject that matches pattern p. The captured value is a string. If p has other captures, their values are returned after this one. local result = lpeg . C ( p ) Parameters : p (pattern): The pattern to capture against. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.Carg \u2693\ufe0e Create an argument capture. This pattern matches the empty string and produces the value given as the nth extra argument given in the call to lpeg.match. local result = lpeg . Carg ( n ) Parameters : n (number): The argument to produce. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.Cb \u2693\ufe0e Create a back capture. This pattern matches the empty string and produces the values produced by the most recent group capture named name (where name can be any Lua value). Most recent means the last complete outermost group capture with the given name. A Complete capture means that the entire pattern corresponding to the capture has matched. An Outermost capture means that the capture is not inside another complete capture. In the same way that LPeg does not specify when it evaluates captures, it does not specify whether it reuses values previously produced by the group or re-evaluates them. local result = lpeg . Cb ( name ) Parameters : name (value): The group capture to produce. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.Cc \u2693\ufe0e Create a constant capture. This pattern matches the empty string and produces all given values as its captured values. local result = lpeg . Cc ( unknown ) Parameters : unnamed (values): Optional . The values to produce. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.Cf \u2693\ufe0e Create a fold capture. If pattern p produces a list of captures C1 C2 ... Cn, this capture will produce the value function f(...f(f(C1, C2), C3)..., Cn), that is, it will fold (or accumulate, or reduce) the captures from p using function f. This capture assumes that p should produce at least one capture with at least one value (of any type), which becomes the initial value of an accumulator. (If you need a specific initial value, you may prefix a constant capture to p.) For each subsequent capture, LPeg calls f with this accumulator as the first argument and all values produced by the capture as extra arguments; the first result from this call becomes the new value for the accumulator. The final value of the accumulator becomes the captured value. local result = lpeg . Cf ( p , f ) Parameters : p (pattern): The pattern to fold with f. f (function): The function to use to fold p. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.Cg \u2693\ufe0e Create a group capture. It groups all values returned by pattern p into a single capture. The group may be anonymous (if no name is given) or named with the given name (which can be any non-nil Lua value). An anonymous group serves to join values from several captures into a single capture. A named group has a different behavior. In most situations, a named group returns no values at all. Its values are only relevant for a following back capture or when used inside a table capture. local result = lpeg . Cg ( p , name ) Parameters : p (pattern): The pattern to capture with. name (value): Optional . The name of the group. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.Cmt \u2693\ufe0e Create a match-time capture. Unlike all other captures, this one is evaluated immediately when a match occurs (even if it is part of a larger pattern that fails later). It forces the immediate evaluation of all its nested captures and then calls function f. The given function gets as arguments the entire subject, the current position (after the match of pattern p), plus any capture values produced by p. The first value returned by f defines how the match happens. If the call returns a number, the match succeeds and the returned number becomes the new current position. (Assuming a subject s and current position i, the returned number must be in the range [i, len(s) + 1].) If the call returns true, the match succeeds without consuming any input. (So, to return true is equivalent to return i.) If the call returns false, nil, or no value, the match fails. Any extra values returned by f become the values produced by the capture. local result = lpeg . Cmt ( p , f ) Parameters : p (pattern): The pattern to capture with. f (function): The function to call to evaluate matches. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.Cp \u2693\ufe0e Create a position capture. It matches the empty string and captures the position in the subject where the match occurs. The captured value is a number. local result = lpeg . Cp () Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.Cs \u2693\ufe0e Create a substitution capture, which captures the substring of the subject that matches pattern p, with substitutions. For any capture inside p with a value, the substring that matched the capture is replaced by the capture value (which should be a string). The final captured value is the string resulting from all replacements. local result = lpeg . Cs ( p ) Parameters : p (pattern): The pattern to capture with. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.Ct \u2693\ufe0e Create a table capture. This capture returns a table with all values from all anonymous captures made by pattern p inside this table in successive integer keys, starting at 1. Moreover, for each named capture group created by p, the first value of the group is put into the table with the group name as its key. The captured value is only the table. local result = lpeg . Ct ( p ) Parameters : p (pattern): The pattern to capture with. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.locale \u2693\ufe0e Return a table with patterns for matching some character classes according to the current locale. The table has fields named alnum, alpha, cntrl, digit, graph, lower, print, punct, space, upper, and xdigit, each one containing a correspondent pattern. Each pattern matches any single character that belongs to its class. If called with an argument table, then it creates those fields inside the given table and returns that table. local result = lpeg . locale ( t ) Parameters : t (table): Optional . The table to update. Returns : result (table) lpeg.match \u2693\ufe0e Attempt to match the given pattern against the subject string. If the match succeeds, return the index in the subject of the first character after the match, or the captured values (if the pattern captured any value). An optional numeric argument init makes the match start at that position in the subject string. As usual in Lua libraries, a negative value counts from the end. Unlike typical pattern-matching functions, match works only in anchored mode; that is, it tries to match the pattern with a prefix of the given subject string (at position init), not with an arbitrary substring of the subject. So, if we want to find a pattern anywhere in a string, we must either write a loop in Lua or write a pattern that matches anywhere. This second approach is easy and quite efficient; see examples in the full documentation for details. local result = lpeg . match ( p , subject , init ) Parameters : p (pattern): The pattern to match. subject (string): The string to match against. init (number): Optional . Start the match at this position in subject. Returns : result (values) Example: Simple Match Create a pattern that matches a word followed by the end of the string, and use it to match strings. local lpeg = require ( \"lpeg\" ) local function onLoaded ( e ) -- matches a word followed by end-of-string local p = lpeg . R ( \"az\" ) ^ 1 * - 1 mwse . log ( p : match ( \"hello\" )) --> 6 mwse . log ( lpeg . match ( p , \"hello\" )) --> 6 mwse . log ( p : match ( \"1 hello\" )) --> nil end event . register ( tes3 . event . loaded , onLoaded ) lpeg.P \u2693\ufe0e Converts the given value into a proper lpeg pattern. If the argument is a pattern, it is returned unmodified. If the argument is a string, it is translated to a pattern that matches the string literally. If the argument is a non-negative number n, the result is a pattern that matches exactly n characters. If the argument is a negative number -n, the result is a pattern that succeeds only if the input string has less than n characters left: lpeg.P(-n) is equivalent to -lpeg.P(n). See the unary minus operation in the full documentation for details. If the argument is a boolean, the result is a pattern that always succeeds or always fails (according to the boolean value), without consuming any input. If the argument is a table, it is interpreted as a grammar. See Grammars in the full documentation for details. If the argument is a function, returns a pattern equivalent to a match-time capture over the empty string. local result = lpeg . P ( value ) Parameters : value (multiple): The value to convert to a pattern. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.R \u2693\ufe0e Returns a pattern that matches any single character belonging to one of the given ranges. Each range is a string xy of length 2, representing all characters with code between the codes of x and y (both inclusive). As an example, the pattern lpeg.R(\"09\") matches any digit, and lpeg.R(\"az\", \"AZ\") matches any ASCII letter. local result = lpeg . R ( p ) Parameters : p (pattern): The input pattern. Returns : result (pattern) Example: Simple Match Create a pattern using lpeg.R that matches a word followed by the end of the string. local lpeg = require ( \"lpeg\" ) local function onLoaded ( e ) -- matches a word followed by end-of-string local p = lpeg . R ( \"az\" ) ^ 1 * - 1 mwse . log ( p : match ( \"hello\" )) --> 6 mwse . log ( lpeg . match ( p , \"hello\" )) --> 6 mwse . log ( p : match ( \"1 hello\" )) --> nil end event . register ( tes3 . event . loaded , onLoaded ) lpeg.S \u2693\ufe0e Returns a pattern that matches any single character that appears in the given string. As an example, the pattern lpeg.S(\"+-*/\") matches any arithmetic operator. Note that, if s is a character (that is, a string of length 1), then lpeg.P(s) is equivalent to lpeg.S(s) which is equivalent to lpeg.R(s..s). Note also that both lpeg.S(\"\") and lpeg.R() are patterns that always fail. local result = lpeg . S ( s ) Parameters : s (string): The input string. Returns : result (pattern) lpeg.setmaxstack \u2693\ufe0e Set a limit for the size of the backtrack stack used by LPeg to track calls and choices. The default limit is 400. Most well-written patterns need little backtrack levels and therefore you seldom need to change this limit; before changing it you should try to rewrite your pattern to avoid the need for extra space. Nevertheless, a few useful patterns may overflow. Also, with recursive grammars, subjects with deep recursion may also need larger limits. lpeg . setmaxstack ( max ) Parameters : max (number): The new stack size. lpeg.type \u2693\ufe0e If the given value is a pattern, return the string \"pattern\". Otherwise return nil. local result = lpeg . type ( value ) Parameters : value (value): The item to evaulate. Returns : result (string) lpeg.V \u2693\ufe0e Create a non-terminal (a variable) for a grammar. The created non-terminal refers to the rule indexed by v in the enclosing grammar. See Grammars in the full documentation for details. local result = lpeg . V ( v ) Parameters : v (string): The index of the desired rule.

A flag which controls whether this effect is considered harmful and casting it can be considered as an attack. * nonRecastable (boolean): Default : true . A flag which controls whether this effect can be recast while it already is in duration. * targetsAttributes (boolean): Default : true . A flag which controls whether this effect targets a certain attribute or attributes. * targetsSkills (boolean): Default : true . A flag which controls whether this effect targets a certain skill or skills. * unreflectable (boolean): Default : true . A flag which controls whether this effect can be reflected. * usesNegativeLighting (boolean): Default : true . A flag which controls whether this effect uses negative lighting. * onTick (function): Optional . A function which will be called on each tick of a spell containing this effect. A table tickParams will be passed to the callback function. Note: dt (frame time) scaling is handled automatically. - tickParams (table) - effectId (number) - sourceInstance ( tes3magicSourceInstance ): Access to the magic source of the effect instance. - deltaTime (number): The time passed since the last tick of the spell. - effectInstance ( tes3magicEffectInstance ): Access to the magic effect instance. - effectIndex (number): The index of the effect in the spell. In addition, a function registered as `onTick` can also call the following methods: - trigger(`triggerParams`): Allows the effect to run through the normal spell event system. **Parameters:** - `triggerParams` (table) - `negateOnExpiry` (boolean): *Optional. Default:* `true` If this flag is `true`, the effect will be negated on expiry. - `isUncapped` (boolean): *Optional.* - `attribute` (number): *Optional. Default:* `tes3.effectAttribute.nonResistable` The attribute used in resistance calculations agains this effect. Maps to values in [`tes3.effectAttribute`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/effect-attributes/) namespace. - `type` (number): *Optional. Default:* `tes3.effectEventType.boolean`. This flag controls how the effect behaves. For example, `tes3.effectEventType.modStatistic` will make the effect work as calling `tes3.modStatistic`. Maps to values in [`tes3.effectEventType`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/effect-event-types/) namespace. - `value` (number): *Optional. Default:* `0`. The variable this effect changes. - `resistanceCheck(resistParams)` (function): *Optional.* The function passed as `resistanceCheck` will be used on any of the game's spell resistance checks. For example, the only effect in vanilla Morrowind that implements this function is Water Walking. It disallows using a spell with Water Walking when the player is deep underwater, by setting it as expired. So, returning `true` from this function will set your effect to expired, and depending on your trigger code may stop processing. The function passed here must returns boolean values. **Parameters** - `resistParams` (table) - `sourceInstance` ([tes3magicSourceInstance](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3magicSourceInstance/)): Access to the magic source of the effect instance. - `effectInstance` ([tes3magicEffectInstance](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3magicEffectInstance/)): Access to the magic effect instance. - `effectIndex` (number): The index of the effect in the spell. - triggerBoundWeapon(`id`): Performs vanilla weapon summoning logic. It will create a summoned version of the weapon with provided ID. **Parameters:** - `id` (string): The ID of the weapon object to summon. - triggerBoundArmor(`params`): Performs vanilla armor summoning logic. It can summon one or two armor objects with provided ID(s). **Parameters:** - `params` (table) - `id` (string): The ID of the armor object to summon. - `id2` (string): *Optional.* The ID of the additional armor object to summon. - triggerSummon(`id`): Performs vanilla creature summoning logic. It will create a summoned version of a creature with provided ID. **Parameters:** - `id` (string): The ID of the creature object to summon. * `onCollision` (function): *Optional*. A function which will be called when a spell containing this spell effect collides with something.

The key passed to this function is the path to where its main.lua file is, relative to the MWSE\\mods folder. Slashes are automatically replaced with periods, and the key is case-insensitive. local isActive = tes3 . isLuaModActive ( key ) Parameters : key (string): The key to check. Returns : isActive (boolean): True if the mod is active, otherwise false. Example: Determine if a Specific Lua Mod is Active In this example, we determine if Chameleon is active. The mod provides no interop files to try to include , and is a simple main.lua file. This makes it hard to otherwise detect. if ( tes3 . isLuaModActive ( \"Danae.Chameleon\" )) then -- Perform some compatibility actions here. end tes3.isModActive \u2693\ufe0e Determines if the player has a given ESP or ESM file active. local result = tes3 . isModActive ( filename ) Parameters : filename (string): The filename of the mod to find, including the extension.

Animation groups present in the file will replace the actor's animation groups. The actor's model must be already loaded into memory to have its animations modified. The overridden animations only persist until the actor is unloaded. Calling this more than once will remove the previous animation override before loading the new animation. Therefore, if applying animations to the player, you should call this before every playAnimation so that different animation mods can co-exist. For NPCs under your mod's control, you only need to do it when the player enters the cell containing the NPC. Calling this without a file argument will reset the reference's animations to default. tes3 . loadAnimation ({ reference = ..., file = ... }) Parameters : params (table) reference ( tes3mobileActor , tes3reference , string): The reference to the actor that is having its animations modified. file (string): Optional . The specified animation base file that will be loaded. e.g. For an animation composed of files anim.nif, xanim.nif and xanim.kf, you should pass file=\"anim.nif\".

An array of strings to use for buttons. callback (function) showInDialog (boolean): Default : true . Specifying showInDialog = false forces the toast-style message, which is not shown in the dialog menu. duration (number): Optional . Overrides how long the toast-style message remains visible. formatAdditions (variadic): Optional . Only used if messageOrParams is a string. Returns : element ( tes3uiElement , nil): The UI menu created for the notification, if any. tes3.modStatistic \u2693\ufe0e Modifies a statistic on a given actor. This should be used instead of manually setting values on the game structures, to ensure that events and GUI elements are properly handled.

Returns : success (boolean) tes3.playAnimation \u2693\ufe0e Plays a given animation group. Optional flags can be used to define how the group starts. When 'group' is specified, the actor AI is paused while playing the animation, as if in an idle state. When one or more of 'lower', 'upper', or 'shield' are specified without 'group', the actor AI retains control, and the animations are layered. e.g. tes3.playAnimation{reference = ..., upper = tes3.animationGroup.idle3, loopCount = 0} will play the idle3 animation once (without looping) on the upper body, while the player or NPC is still able to walk around. Using 'upper' defers combat actions until the animation is done. Using 'shield' still allows combat actions. As a special case, tes3.playAnimation{reference = ..., group = 0} returns control to the AI, as the AI knows that is the actor's neutral idle state. tes3 . playAnimation ({ reference = ..., group = ..., lower = ..., upper = ..., shield = ..., startFlag = ..., loopCount = ..., mesh = ... }) Parameters : params (table) reference ( tes3mobileActor , tes3reference , string): The reference that will play the animation. group (number): Optional .

A flag which controls whether this effect can be reflected. * usesNegativeLighting (boolean): Default : true . A flag which controls whether this effect uses negative lighting. * onTick (function): Optional . A function which will be called on each tick of a spell containing this effect. A table tickParams will be passed to the callback function. Note: dt (frame time) scaling is handled automatically. - tickParams (table) - effectId (number) - sourceInstance ( tes3magicSourceInstance ): Access to the magic source of the effect instance. - deltaTime (number): The time passed since the last tick of the spell. - effectInstance ( tes3magicEffectInstance ): Access to the magic effect instance. - effectIndex (number): The index of the effect in the spell. In addition, a function registered as `onTick` can also call the following methods: - trigger(`triggerParams`): Allows the effect to run through the normal spell event system. **Parameters:** - `triggerParams` (table) - `negateOnExpiry` (boolean): *Optional. Default:* `true` If this flag is `true`, the effect will be negated on expiry. - `isUncapped` (boolean): *Optional.* - `attribute` (number): *Optional. Default:* `tes3.effectAttribute.nonResistable` The attribute used in resistance calculations agains this effect. Maps to values in [`tes3.effectAttribute`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/effect-attributes/) namespace. - `type` (number): *Optional. Default:* `tes3.effectEventType.boolean`. This flag controls how the effect behaves. For example, `tes3.effectEventType.modStatistic` will make the effect work as calling `tes3.modStatistic`. Maps to values in [`tes3.effectEventType`](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/references/effect-event-types/) namespace. - `value` (number): *Optional. Default:* `0`. The variable this effect changes. - `resistanceCheck(resistParams)` (function): *Optional.* The function passed as `resistanceCheck` will be used on any of the game's spell resistance checks. For example, the only effect in vanilla Morrowind that implements this function is Water Walking. It disallows using a spell with Water Walking when the player is deep underwater, by setting it as expired. So, returning `true` from this function will set your effect to expired, and depending on your trigger code may stop processing. The function passed here must returns boolean values. **Parameters** - `resistParams` (table) - `sourceInstance` ([tes3magicSourceInstance](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3magicSourceInstance/)): Access to the magic source of the effect instance. - `effectInstance` ([tes3magicEffectInstance](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/types/tes3magicEffectInstance/)): Access to the magic effect instance. - `effectIndex` (number): The index of the effect in the spell. - triggerBoundWeapon(`id`): Performs vanilla weapon summoning logic. It will create a summoned version of the weapon with provided ID. **Parameters:** - `id` (string): The ID of the weapon object to summon. - triggerBoundArmor(`params`): Performs vanilla armor summoning logic. It can summon one or two armor objects with provided ID(s). **Parameters:** - `params` (table) - `id` (string): The ID of the armor object to summon. - `id2` (string): *Optional.* The ID of the additional armor object to summon. - triggerSummon(`id`): Performs vanilla creature summoning logic. It will create a summoned version of a creature with provided ID. **Parameters:** - `id` (string): The ID of the creature object to summon. * `onCollision` (function): *Optional*. A function which will be called when a spell containing this spell effect collides with something.

Open the console to see the result.\" ) end event . register ( tes3 . event . keyDown , printNames , { filter = tes3 . scanCode . u }) tes3ui.logToConsole \u2693\ufe0e Logs a message to the console. Consider using tes3ui.log instead of this function if you do not need to make use of the isCommand parameter. tes3ui . logToConsole ( text , isCommand ) Parameters : text (string) isCommand (boolean): Default : false . Passing true will make the text in the console selectable by using up arrow key. If it is a valid command, then pressing enter will call it. Example: This example describes how this function behaves with isCommand = true. local function example () -- This will make \"player->ModStrength 10\" appear in the console coloured brown. -- It can't be selected by using up arrow key. tes3ui . logToConsole ( \"player->ModStrength 10\" , false ) -- This will make \"player->ModWillpower 10\" appear in the console coloured blue. -- It CAN be selected by using up arrow key, and when the enter is pressed, -- it will call that function. tes3ui . logToConsole ( \"player->ModWillpower 10\" , true ) tes3 . messageBox ( \"Done!

This will not function if the help menu does not currently exist, or if it is not currently visible. tes3ui . refreshTooltip () tes3ui.registerID \u2693\ufe0e Registers a UI element name, returning a UI_ID. Once a property is registered, this function always returns the same UI_ID. These UI_IDs are used by the API to locate elements that may not exist (a weak reference), instead of by element name. The registry namespace is shared between Property and UI_ID. It is advisable to use a namespace prefix to avoid collisions with other mods. local result = tes3ui . registerID ( s ) Parameters : s (string) Returns : result (number) tes3ui.registerProperty \u2693\ufe0e Registers a property name, returning a Property. Once a property is registered, this function always returns the same Property. The registry namespace is shared between Property and UI_ID.

See bookGetText for an example of properly formatted book text. tes3ui . showBookMenu ( text ) Parameters : text (string) tes3ui.showDialogueMessage \u2693\ufe0e This function creates a dialogue message. The message can have three styles. The style 2 makes a selectable text. That way by calling this function multiple time you can create a selection of responses. tes3ui . showDialogueMessage ({ text = ..., style = ..., answerIndex = ... }) Parameters : params (table) text (string): Default : ``. The text of the shown message. style (number): Default : 0 . This argument controls the text color of the message. Value 0 makes the message text the same color as the text in the dialogue window. Value 1 makes the text white, and also print a newline after the message. Value 2 turns the message into a selectable text inside the dialogue window. Value 3 looks the same as 1 but there isn't a newline after each message. Value 4 is the same as value 1 . All the other values work as 0 . answerIndex (number): Default : 0 . This number can be used later to identify which response was selected. tes3ui.showInventorySelectMenu \u2693\ufe0e This function opens the inventory select menu which lets the player select items from an inventory. These items can be selected from any actor's inventory and can be filtered with the filter callback.

The text used for the message that gets shown to the player if no items have been found in the inventory. The default text is equivalent to the sInventorySelectNoItems GMST value, unless \"ingredients\" or \"soulgemFilled\" has been assigned to filter , in which case the default text is equivalent to either the sInventorySelectNoIngredients or sInventorySelectNoSoul GMST value respectively. noResultsCallback (function): Optional . A function which is called when no items have been found in the inventory, right before the message containing noResultsText is shown. filter (function, string): Optional . This determines which items should be shown in the inventory select menu. Accepts either a string or a function. If assigning a string, the available values are present in tes3.inventorySelectFilter namespace. The available filters are: alembic : Only tes3apparatus items of type tes3.apparatusType.alembic will be shown. calcinator : Only tes3apparatus items of type tes3.apparatusType.calcinator will be shown. enchanted : Only non-enchanted items will be shown.

To facilitate this, this guide will explain how to create a mod that displays a unique messagebox every time the player draws a two-handed weapon. Development Workflow \u2693\ufe0e A Development Workflow is the environment and processes used to facilitate software development. This guide assumes that you have setup a development environment. If you have not set up a development environment, or do not know how to, please refer to the Development Workflow guide to set one up. Introduction to the Lua Scripting Language \u2693\ufe0e If you have basic knowledge of the Lua scripting language, you may skip this section. If you are not familiar with the Lua scripting language, please take a moment to read the Introduction to Lua guide. Introduction to Event Based Programming \u2693\ufe0e If you have basic knowledge of event based programming, you may skip this section. If you are not familiar with event based programming, please take a moment to read the Introduction to Event Based Programming guide. Creating the Mod File Structure \u2693\ufe0e Now that you have setup a development workflow, you are ready to create a mod. Next, the folder structure for MWSE must be created: In the Morrowind \"Data Files\" directory, create a folder named \"MWSE\". This is the folder that contains any MWSE code. In \"MWSE\", create a folder named \"mods\". This is the folder that contains any MWSE mod code. Other options include \"lib\" for user-made frameworks and libraries. In \"mods\", create a folder named \"MWSE-Guide-Demo\". This is the folder that contains the MWSE code for our mod. This folder can include spaces in the folder name. In a normal Morrowind install, you may see other folders here. These represent other mod's code files. The newly created folder structure should look like this: Morrowind\\Data Files\\MWSE\\mods\\MWSE-Guide-Demo Now that the folder structure is complete, you must create a code file to run your code in. In \"MWSE-Guide-Demo\", create a file named main.lua . This file will contain the Lua code for the mod. The main file of your mod must be named main.lua . This file should configure and initialize any other code files in your mod. The name main.lua is required by MWSE. Registering an Event \u2693\ufe0e The Morrowind game engine, through MWSE, provides a variety of events that can be used to trigger code. An event is a trigger that will notify any registered functions of it's occurrence. For example, consider the loaded event. This event is triggered whenever the player loads a save game. If you register a function to be called when this event occurs, your function will be called when the player loads a save game. By cleverly using Morrowind's events, powerful functionality can be created. In our file, main.lua , we will register an event to trigger our code. It is convention to register your mod's events inside of another event, the initialized event. The initialized event represents the point when the game and it's mods have been loaded. You can imagine this as the point which the title screen is first shown. So, first, we will create the initialized event. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -- The function to call on the initialized event. local function initialized () -- 1. -- Print a \"Ready!\" statement to the MWSE.log file. print ( \"[MWSE Guide Demo: INFO] MWSE Guide Demo Initialized\" ) --2. end -- Register our initialized function to the initialized event. event . register ( tes3 . event . initialized , initialized ) --3. Declare a function to call whenever the initialized event is triggered. It is convention to print a statement stating your mod is initialized at the end of your initialized event function. This is used for debugging. Register our initialized function to the initialized event. Now, we want to register an event for what we are actually interested in. In this guide, we are creating a mod that displays a unique messagebox every time the player draws a two-handed weapon. There is an event for that! It is called the weaponReadied event. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 -- The function to call on the showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied event. local function showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied ( e ) -- 1. tes3 . messageBox ( \"I just drew some weapon.\" ) -- 2. end -- The function to call on the initialized event. local function initialized () -- Register our function to the weaponReadied event. event . register ( tes3 . event . weaponReadied , showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied ) --3. -- Print a \"Ready!\" statement to the MWSE.log file. print ( \"[MWSE Guide Demo: INFO] MWSE Guide Demo Initialized\" ) end -- Register our initialized function to the initialized event. event . register ( tes3 . event . initialized , initialized ) Declare a function to call whenever the weaponReadied event is triggered. Add a simple messagebox command. Register our showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied function to the weaponReadied event. At this point, the mod can be tested to confirm the events are set up correctly. To do this, follow the workflow described at the beginning of this guide. When you draw your weapon in-game, you should see a messagebox popup! The details of which events are available and what event data is exposed to them can be found on the events page. Validating the Event & Showing a Messagebox \u2693\ufe0e Now that the required events have been set up, the showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied function should be updated to restrict the types of actions that our code applies to. For the purposes of this guide, the function will only apply to two-handed weapons, and only to the player.

In a normal Morrowind install, you may see other folders here. These represent other mod's code files. The newly created folder structure should look like this: Morrowind\\Data Files\\MWSE\\mods\\MWSE-Guide-Demo Now that the folder structure is complete, you must create a code file to run your code in. In \"MWSE-Guide-Demo\", create a file named main.lua . This file will contain the Lua code for the mod. The main file of your mod must be named main.lua . This file should configure and initialize any other code files in your mod. The name main.lua is required by MWSE.","title":"Creating the Mod File Structure"},{"location":"guides/creating-a-mod/#registering-an-event","text":"The Morrowind game engine, through MWSE, provides a variety of events that can be used to trigger code. An event is a trigger that will notify any registered functions of it's occurrence. For example, consider the loaded event. This event is triggered whenever the player loads a save game. If you register a function to be called when this event occurs, your function will be called when the player loads a save game. By cleverly using Morrowind's events, powerful functionality can be created. In our file, main.lua , we will register an event to trigger our code. It is convention to register your mod's events inside of another event, the initialized event. The initialized event represents the point when the game and it's mods have been loaded. You can imagine this as the point which the title screen is first shown. So, first, we will create the initialized event. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -- The function to call on the initialized event. local function initialized () -- 1. -- Print a \"Ready!\" statement to the MWSE.log file. print ( \"[MWSE Guide Demo: INFO] MWSE Guide Demo Initialized\" ) --2. end -- Register our initialized function to the initialized event. event . register ( tes3 . event . initialized , initialized ) --3. Declare a function to call whenever the initialized event is triggered. It is convention to print a statement stating your mod is initialized at the end of your initialized event function. This is used for debugging. Register our initialized function to the initialized event. Now, we want to register an event for what we are actually interested in. In this guide, we are creating a mod that displays a unique messagebox every time the player draws a two-handed weapon. There is an event for that! It is called the weaponReadied event. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 -- The function to call on the showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied event. local function showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied ( e ) -- 1. tes3 . messageBox ( \"I just drew some weapon.\" ) -- 2. end -- The function to call on the initialized event. local function initialized () -- Register our function to the weaponReadied event. event . register ( tes3 . event . weaponReadied , showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied ) --3. -- Print a \"Ready!\" statement to the MWSE.log file. print ( \"[MWSE Guide Demo: INFO] MWSE Guide Demo Initialized\" ) end -- Register our initialized function to the initialized event. event . register ( tes3 . event . initialized , initialized ) Declare a function to call whenever the weaponReadied event is triggered. Add a simple messagebox command. Register our showMessageboxOnWeaponReadied function to the weaponReadied event. At this point, the mod can be tested to confirm the events are set up correctly. To do this, follow the workflow described at the beginning of this guide. When you draw your weapon in-game, you should see a messagebox popup!

After it is installed, we will also need some Lua-focused extensions. You will also need to make sure that MWSE is up to date. Install MWSE and run MWSE-Update. The simplest way to install these extensions is to open the Data Files\\MWSE folder in Visual Studio Code using File > Open Folder . A prompt should show up to install a few extensions. Other editors can be used if desired, but little support will be offered. All MWSE-Lua content is in simple text files, and any text editor can be used.

Wrye Mash \u2693\ufe0e A advanced development environment uses Wrye Mash to manage your mod. To setup this environment, do the following: Create a clean Morrowind install, Morrowind-Dev. Install MWSE and all its requirements. Be sure to run MWSE-Update.exe to get the latest version. Install Wrye Mash . Configure Wrye Mash to use your Morrowind-Dev install as the Morrowind directory. Configure Wrye Mash to use your development folder as the mod directory. This can be any location on your computer where you want to store your development files. Open the Data Files\\MWSE folder in Visual Studio Code . To use this environment to develop mods while maintaining a clean install, you can do the following: Make changes as needed to your code. Open Wrye Mash. If you created or deleted files as part of your code changes, use Wrye Mash's Refresh Data tool to reload the install files for your mod. Install your updated mod using Wrye Mash. Start Morrowind and complete testing as needed. Close Morrowind. Uninstall your updated mod using Wrye Mash. This workflow ensures that you maintain a clean Morrowind-Dev install, do not have mod conflicts during testing, and are always testing with the most up-to-date files.

For example, you may want to register a function for the keyDown event, but only have your code trigger when a certain key is pressed. You can use event filters for this. 1 2 -- Filter by the scan code to get Z key presses only. event . register ( tes3 . event . key , myOnKeyCallback , { filter = tes3 . scanCode . z } ) Different filters can be applied to different events. Please refer to the documentation for the event that you want to filter for more information.

Lua In Context \u2693\ufe0e The following information is based on information from the Lua 5.1 Reference Manual . Lua is an extension programming language. It can be executed by other, traditional languages, such as C, C++, and C#. In the context of MWSE, this means that the MWSE executable can load Lua code and execute it. This ability allows modders to use Lua to create powerful mods for Morrowind, accomplishing things that were previously impossible. One important detail of Lua is that, unlike other languages, it does not have a Main method. This means that it has no mechanism through which to execute itself. In other words, it can only be executed if embedded in another program, called a host client . In the context of MWSE, MWSE is the host client. However, MWSE does require a files named main.lua to execute your code. The MWSE executable will load any file named main.lua and execute the code within. In practice, this means that the main.lua file performs the same role as a traditional main method in C or C++: it provides an entry point into your code.

Starting in MWSE 2.1, modders are able to create powerful, event-driven modifications to The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind using the Lua scripting language. Unlike traditional mwscript, Lua scripting is responsive. Instead of checking every frame to see if an object is being activated, a mod might register to see if their reference was activated. This introduction covers the surface of the different components important to scripting with MWSE-Lua. Lua files do not reside in esms/esps, but rather live in the Data Files\\MWSE directory. Lua Scripting Language \u2693\ufe0e This guide is not meant to be a comprehensive introduction to the Lua language. Its syntax is simple. The following code block demonstrates what the language looks like: -- Define a simple function that takes a single parameter. local function myFunctionName ( firstFunctionParameter ) -- Print to the MWSE log, with the value that was passed. mwse . log ( \"Called my function with parameter = %s\" , firstFunctionParameter ) end -- Print \"foo\" to the MWSE log, prefixed with the function above. myFunctionName ( \"foo\" ) For a broader introduction to the Lua scripting language, refer to the Introduction to Lua guide. Morrowind Object Types \u2693\ufe0e MWSE provides many bindings to more directly manipulate the object types that the Morrowind engine uses. In this example, we find the skooma object, and rename it No-No Juice . -- Tell MWSE that we want to find the skooma object. local skooma = tes3 . getObject ( \"potion_skooma_01\" ) -- Set the skooma object's name. skooma . name = \"No-No Juice\" A complete list of exposed TES3 types and their associated properties/functions can be seen on the respective tes3 types _ page. Events \u2693\ufe0e Events are the primary way in which script modules interact with the game. There are many event hooks, covering everything from player level up to object collisions to world activations. Using an event typically looks like this: -- Define our callback, which will get called when the event happens. local function myKeyEvent ( eventData ) if ( eventData . pressed ) then mwse . log ( \"Key #%d was pressed.\" , eventData . keyCode ) else mwse . log ( \"Key #%d was released.\" , eventData . keyCode ) end end -- Tell MWSE that we want our callback to be invoked when a key is pressed. event . register ( tes3 . event . key , myKeyEvent ) We can also pass filters to events. For the key event, the filter is the key that was pressed/released. -- If we use this instead of the above registration, we filter to key 22 (U). event . register ( tes3 . event . key , myKeyEvent , { filter = tes3 . scanCode . u }) For a broader introduction to event based programming, refer to the Introduction to Event Based Programming guide. The details of which events are available and what event data is exposed to them can be found on the events page. Support Libraries \u2693\ufe0e On top of all this are support libraries to help make modding easier. An example library is timer , which helps to manage time-based operations. -- Define the function we want to call when our timer completes. local function myTimerCallback () tes3 . messageBox ({ message = \"My timer completed!\" }) end -- Start a timer that finishes after 5 seconds. -- When it does finish it will call the above function. timer . start ( 5 , myTimerCallback ) An Unsandboxed World \u2693\ufe0e MWSE does not do any sandboxing for mods. This enables clever innovations, like Sky Diversity , without the need for externally running programs. This also means that MWSE mods can bring in any lua modules they wish to package. Additionally, they can bring in native code -- allowing powerful extensions that Oblivion and Skyrim have had for years. Mod Initialization Scripts \u2693\ufe0e So how do you access all this, and start getting your fingers into the event systems? Unlike vanilla mwscript, Lua scripts are not explicitly restricted to an actively running game. They are also not restricted to esp files -- many MWSE-Lua mods do not require an esp (though may choose to see if an esp is active for an easier user experience). By placing a file with the name main.lua inside the lua folder or any of its subdirectories, that file will get executed when the game is being initialized (e.g. before any esm/esp files are accessed). For example, with the file Data Files\\MWSE\\mods\\demo\\main.lua in place, it will get executed. With the following contents, it will ensure that when a save game is loaded, we get the save game filename printed to our log. local function myLoadedGameCallback ( e ) mwse . log ( \"Loaded game: %s\" , e . filename ) end event . register ( tes3 . event . loaded , myLoadedGameCallback ) Script Overrides and OpenMW Semi-Compatibility \u2693\ufe0e Another feature of MWSE-Lua is the ability to override the normal execution of mwscript. This means that if we have a script in an esp file called myScript we can do the following code to override its behavior: local function myOverrideFunction ( params ) tes3 . messageBox ( string.format ( \"I'm running script '%s' on reference '%s' from Lua, not mwscript!\" , params . script . id , params . reference . id )) end -- Use the above function instead of mwscript logic. mwse . overrideScript ( \"myScript\" , myOverrideFunction ) OpenMW will not be adding compatibility with MWSE mods, legacy or Lua-based. But script overrides exposes a way for modders to write mods that have extended MWSE functionality without causing issues in OpenMW. Basic functionality can be kept to mwscript, while the script can be overriden to enable advanced functionality using Lua. Getting Started \u2693\ufe0e Not sure where to start?

This can be deu.lua , fra.lua , or rus.lua . When the i18n translation result is called, it returns the translation for the player's current language with the key \"Hello world!\" . Translation Files \u2693\ufe0e The translation files available in the i18n folder follow a simple format, but it warrants description here. Each is a simple lua file that returns a table. The keys in that table can be passed to the i18n value returned from mwse.loadTranslations to get a translation for the player's language. A translation value is typically a string, but it can also have support for different translations based on values fed. File Encoding MWSE automatically handles encoding of language files. All language files should be written using UTF-8. Dots in Translation Keys When using dots to break apart translation keys, be careful of not to use a category as a value. For example, the following will create an error: return = { [ \"mcm.component.console\" ] = \"Enable console component?\" , [ \"mcm.component.console.description\" ] = \"It's really cool, so you should.\" , } Instead, use something like: return = { [ \"mcm.component.console.label\" ] = \"Enable console component?\" , [ \"mcm.component.console.description\" ] = \"It's really cool, so you should.\" , } Pluralization \u2693\ufe0e i18n supports the unicode.org plural rules , to make translations more intelligent and context-sensitive. We will discuss feeding values for this shortly. Consider this example, handling how to display the number of iron daggers the player has: Pluralization i18n\\eng.lua : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 return = { itemCountNotification = { zero = \"You have no %{item}s.\" , one = \"You have 1 %{item}.\" , other = \"You have %{count} %{item}s.\" , }, } main.lua : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 local i18n = mwse . loadTranslations ( \"Iron Dagger Counter\" ) local function onPressZ ( e ) local dagger = tes3 . getObject ( \"iron dagger\" ) local daggerCount = tes3 . getItemCount ({ reference = tes3 . player , item = dagger }) tes3 . messageBox ( i18n ( \"itemCountNotification\" , { count = daggerCount , item = dagger . name })) end event . register ( tes3 . event . keyDown , onPressZ , { filter = tes3 . scanCode . z }) Here, the correct language will be chosen depending on the context of daggerCount . If the player has no iron daggers, \"You have no Iron Daggers.\" will be displayed. If the player has exactly 1 iron dagger, \"You have 1 Iron Dagger.\" . Finally, in any other case, the other key is used. A few other pluralization fields are available: few and many . few is used when value % 100 is between 3 and 10. many is used when value % 100 is between 11 and 99.

The documentation found here is for legacy purposes only. None of the following functions can be used directly from Lua. xActivate \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: reference target : What the reference will try to activate. Returned: None This function allows the forced activation of one reference onto another. Unlike the vanilla Activate function, this allows variable input and will work even when OnActivate hasn't been triggered in the script. .. note:: Unlike the vanilla activate function, the reference is the actor that will activate something, rather than the object to activate. Force the PC to Activate begin test long targetRef long pcRef ; Don't force pickup if we're not sneaking. if ( GetPCSneaking == 0 ) return endif ; Get a reference to what the player is looking at. setx targetRef to xGetPCTarget if ( targetRef == 0 ) return endif ; Get a reference to the player, and force them to activate what they are looking at. setx pcRef to xGetRef \"player\" pcRef->xActivate targetRef end xAddSpell \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string objectID : The object ID of the spell to add. Returned: None This is a wrapper for the vanilla AddSpell function that can take variable input. xAITravel \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: float x : The position to travel to on the X axis. float y : The position to travel to on the Y axis. float z : The position to travel to on the Z axis. Returned: None This is a wrapper for the vanilla AITravel function that can take variable input. xDrop \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string objectID : The object ID of the item to drop. long count : The number of items to drop. Returned: None This is a wrapper for the vanilla Drop function that can take variable input. Note xDrop N+1 items will leave 1 phantom icon plus N real items in the dropping actors inventory. xGetItemCount will not report the 1 phantom icon. However, xRemoveItem will remove the phantom safely. So \"safe\" procedure for xDrop seems to be to follow up with xRemoveItem of the same count. Additionally for non-player actors in menumode, exit and re-entry to menumode is needed to refresh the icons and avoid phantom icon interaction that could result in permanent item doubling or CTD. This also applies to the standard drop function. xEquip \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string objectID : The object ID of the item to equip. Returned: None This is a wrapper for the vanilla Equip function that can take variable input. xGetAttribute \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long attributeID : The Attribute ID to get the value of.

Returns the base value of the referenced object's skill. Note This function only supports the player and NPCs. xGetClass \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long attributesMask : A bit mask to apply to the attributes value. long majorMask : A bit mask to apply to the majorSkills value. long minorMask : A bit mask to apply to the minorSkills value. Returned: string classID : The unique string identifier of the class. string name : The name of the class. long playable : 1 if the class can be chosen by the PC, 0 otherwise. long specialization : 0 = Combat, 1 = Magic, 2 = Stealth long attributes : A bitmap of the two primary attributes. The result is obtained by adding the values found in the attributes table below. long majorSkills : A bitmap of the 5 major skills. The result is obtained by adding the values found in the skills table below. long minorSkills : A bitmap of the 5 minor skills. The result is obtained by adding the values found in the skills table below. Returns info about the class of the target NPC/PC, or 0 if the target is not an NPC or the PC.

Returns a reference to the reference NPC/creature's combat target, or 0 if the reference is not in combat. xGetGold \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: long gold : The reference's current barter gold. xGetGold returns the current amount of barter gold possessed by the NPC (or creature). The base gold amount is used if you haven't bartered with the NPC/creature recently. xGetMagic \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: long objectType : The Object Type of the equipped magical source. string objectID : The object ID of the spell or enchantment selected. Returns the currently equipped spell or enchanted item. This is specifically the object that appears in the equipped magic slot and includes on-use magical items as well as spells.

Returned (returnType is 0): string raceID : The object ID of the target's race. Returned (returnType is 1): array arrayID : An array ID containing the values of the race. This function fetches the objectID or complete details about the target's race. Warning The arrays returned by this function when returnType is 1 are volatile. They should not be used for custom storage. Whenever xGetRace is called, the arrays are cleared and refilled with up-to-date information. If returnType is 0 , the response is the race's object ID. Otherwise, the returned array contains the following values: Index Type Contents 0 string Object ID. 1 string Name. 2 array Skill bonuses. 3 array Starting attributes. 4 float Male height. 5 float Female height. 6 float Male weight. 7 float Female weight. 8 long Playable flag. 9 long Beast flag. The skill bonuses array begins with index 0 holding the number of skill bonuses (a value between 0 and 7). Pairs of values are then returned. The odd indexes hold the Skill while the even indexes hold the bonus to the given skill. The starting attributes array contains the following values: Index Type Contents 0 long Male strength. 1 long Female strength. 2 long Male intelligence. 3 long Female intelligence. 4 long Male willpower. 5 long Female willpower. 6 long Male agility. 7 long Female agility. 8 long Male speed. 9 long Female speed. 10 long Male endurance. 11 long Female endurance. 12 long Male personality. 13 long Female personality. 14 long Male luck. 15 long Female luck. xGetService \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long mask : A filter to limit the services returned. Returned: long services : The services offered by the reference, limited by mask . This function returns a bitfield of services offered by a given reference. The service values are shown in the following table. If an NPC offers more than one service the sum of the service numbers will be returned. The mask parameter can be used as a filter to limit the return value to only consider the services indicated. Value Service 1 Barters for weapons. 2 Barters for armor. 4 Barters for clothing. 8 Barters for books. 16 Barters for ingredients. 32 Barters for lockpicks. 64 Barters for probes. 128 Barters for lights. 256 Barters for alchemical apparatus. 512 Barters for repair tools. 1024 Barters for miscellaneous items. 2048 Offers spells. 4096 Barters for enchanted items. 8192 Barters for potions. 16384 Provides training. 32768 Provides spellmaking service. 65536 Provides enchanting service. 131072 Repairs armor and weapons. Note Previous versions of MWSE made use of xIsTrader , xIsTrainer , and xIsProvider . This function supersedes those. Old scripts that use them will continue to work, but new scripts should make use of xGetService . xGetSkill \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long skillID : The Skill ID to get the value of. Returned: float value : Current value of the skill. Returns the current value of the referenced object's skill. Note This function only supports the player and NPCs. xGetSpell \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string spellID : The spell ID to search for. Returned: long result : 1 if the spell was found, otherwise 0 . Returns 1 if spellId is present, 0 otherwise. This is not a wrapper for GetSpell ; it's a reimplementation. It only works for NPCs and the player. xGetSpellEffects \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string spellID : The spell ID to check for. Returned: long result : 1 if the object is equipped, otherwise 0 . Returns 1 if the calling object is under the effect of the given spell, or 0 otherwise. xHasItemEquipped \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string objectID : The object ID to check if equipped. Returned: long result : 1 if the object is equipped, otherwise 0 . Returns 1 if the NPC or creature has the object equipped, 0 otherwise. xIsFemale \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: long result : 1 if the reference is female, otherwise 0 . Returns 1 if the NPC is female and 0 otherwise. xModAttribute \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long attributeID : The Attribute ID to modify. float value : The value to modify the attribute by. Returned: short result : Result of the function. Modifies the current and base values of the specified attribute. This suffers from the same display issue as xSetLevel. It ignores the 100 max attribute limit. Note This function only supports the player and NPCs. xModService \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long services : The combined value of services the reference should offer (positive) or refuse (negative). Returned: None Uses the services parameter to modify the services offered by an NPC. A positive value adds that service (or set of services) to those already offered. A negative value will remove a service or service. The changes are not permanent. Value Service 1 Barters for weapons. 2 Barters for armor. 4 Barters for clothing. 8 Barters for books. 16 Barters for ingredients. 32 Barters for lockpicks. 64 Barters for probes. 128 Barters for lights. 256 Barters for alchemical apparatus. 512 Barters for repair tools. 1024 Barters for miscellaneous items. 2048 Offers spells. 4096 Barters for enchanted items. 8192 Barters for potions. 16384 Provides training. 32768 Provides spellmaking service. 65536 Provides enchanting service. 131072 Repairs armor and weapons. xRemoveSpell \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string objectID : The object ID of the spell to remove. Returned: None This is a wrapper for the vanilla RemoveSpell function that can take variable input. xSetBaseGold \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long gold : New value to set the reference's base barter gold to. Returned: None Changes the base amount of barter gold assigned to the NPC (or creature). Unfortunately this change won't be saved with the save game so you will need to reset it after each game reload or after the \"72-hour bug\" affects the merchant. xSetGold \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long gold : New value to set the reference's current barter gold to. Returned: None xSetGold changes the current amount of barter gold possessed by the NPC (or creature). This value is stored in save game files so it will survive a game reload. Setting this will have no effect if you haven't recently bartered with the NPC/creature.

In following iterations, this value will be what is returned as nextNode from the previous call. Returned: string id : The object ID string of the item. long count : How many items are in the item stack. long type : The Object Type of the item. long value : The value of the item. float weight : The weight of the item. (Always 0.000001 for LEVI objects.) string name : The name of the item. long nextNode : The next node to provide back into this function to continue looping. When this value is 0, there are no more items. This function allows a script to iterate through the inventory of an actor or container and retrieve information about the contents found. Unlike the xInventory and xNextStack functions, xContentList also provides access to the type, value, weight, and name of items processed. If you are only interested in items of specific types, consider using xContentListFiltered instead. If you are only interested in items currently equipped by the actor, consider using xEquipmentList . xContentListFiltered \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long node : For the first call, this should be 0 to get the first item. In following iterations, this value will be what is returned as nextNode from the previous call. long filter : A filter that matches the Filter Mask that is desired. Only items matching the type(s) will be returned. This means that passing a value of 0 will return nothing.

When this value is 0, there are no more items. This function behaves similar to xContentList , with the added convenience of filtering for one or more Object Type . If you are trying to specifically get the equipped items of an actor, consider using xEquipmentList . Filter Mask \u2693\ufe0e The filter mask below is meant to be summed for each Object Type desired in the filter. The exception to this rule is the ENCH filter, which restricts the results to enchanted items.

When this value is 0, there are no more equipped items. This function behaves similar to xContentList / xContentListFiltered , returning inventory information. This allows looping over equipped items instead of all items in the target's inventory. Note The subTypeFilter parameter does not exactly match the associated table. Instead, the function requires one more than the value on the table. For example if searching for clothing objects, a value of 0 will perform no filtering by subtype, while a value of 1 will filter for only pants.

Only spellmaking, enchanting, and negative lighting are valid here. All others are ignored. Returned: long result : 1 on success, 0 on failure. This function changes the properties of the effect for all magic that uses it. Changes to school and flags take effect immediately. E.g. if you have a spell with a Fire Damage effect and you change the Fire Damage school to Alteration, casting that spell will raise Alteration instead of Destruction. Likewise, if you clear the Spellmaking or Enchanting flags, Fire Damage will no longer be available at the respective crafter. Changes to the base cost take effect on any subsequent spell or magic item creation, but don't affect any spells or items already in the game. xSetEffectInfo \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long type : The Object Type of the object to alter. string id : The object ID of the object to alter. long index : The index of the effect to alter. long effectID : The Effect Type to change to. long skillOrAttributeID : The Attribute or Skill ID to use, if the effectID uses one. long rangeType : 0 = self, 1 = touch, 2 = target. long area : Area of effect. long duration : Effect duration (in seconds). long minimumMagnitude : Minimum magnitude. long maximumMagnitude : Maximum magnitude.

Returned: float distance : The distance between the calling reference and the target reference. Calculates the distance between the calling reference and target . .. note:: Unlike the vanilla GetDistance function, this function will work on non-actors. Distance from PC Target This example calculates the distance between the PC and what they are looking at. begin DistanceToTarget long pcRef long targetRef float distance setx pcRef to xGetRef \"player\" setx targetRef to xGetPCTarget setx distance to pcRef->xDistance targetRef end xExplodeSpell \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string objectID : The object ID of the spell to explode. Returned: None This is a wrapper for the vanilla ExplodeSpell function that can take variable input. xGetBaseID \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: string id : The reference's base object ID. xGetBaseID returns reference's base object ID. In contrast to xRefID , this function will not include the hexadecimal suffix that identifies unique instances of containers, creatures, or NPCs. For example, where xRefID would return \"Fargoth00000000\" , xGetBaseID would instead return just \"Fargoth\" . xGetCharge \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: float charge : The current charge on a item. Returns the current charge on a 'cast when used' or 'cast when strikes' enchanted item. Constant effect and non-enchanted items return 0 . xGetCondition \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: float condition : The current condition on a item. Returns the current condition for armor and weapons and remaining uses for lockpicks, probes, and repair tools. xGetEnchant \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: string enchantID : The Object ID of the enchantment. short type : The type of the enchantment. 0 = Cast Once, 1 = Cast on Strike, 2 = Cast on Use, 3 = Constant short cost : The cost of the enchantment. float currentCharge : The current charge for the enchantment. long maxCharge : The maximum charge for the enchantment. short numEffect : The number of effects on the enchantment. long autocalc : 1 if the enchantment is auto-calculated. Returns info about the enchantment on the target item, or 0 if no enchantment is present. xGetEncumb \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: float weight : The weight, in pounds, of all the reference's inventory. This value is negative if leveled items are present. Calculates the total, unmodified encumbrance of the target reference's inventory. This function does not take into account any feather or burden spell effects. Note If the target has any leveled items in its inventory, the returned weight is negative. xGetItemCount \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string objectId : The item's object ID to get the count of. Returned: long itemCount : The number of items that the reference has. This is a wrapper function around GetItemCount that allows variable input.

Returns the lock level of a door or container. This function returns -1 for doors/containers that have never been locked and for items that aren't doors or containers. This returns the lock level regardless of whether the item is locked or unlocked. Use GetLocked to determine the state of the lock. Lock level is stored as a signed short (16 bits, max value = 32,767). Values less than 0 do not survive saving, exiting, and reloading. They are converted to their absolute value and the door/container is flagged as unlocked. xGetMaxCharge \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: float maxCharge : The current charge on a item. Returns the maximum charge on an enchanted item. xGetMaxCondition \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: float maxCondition : The current maximum condition on a item. Returns the maxium condition for armor and weapons and maximum uses for lockpicks, probes, and repair tools. xGetModel \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string objectId : The object ID to get the model of. If 0, the reference will be used. Returned: string modelPath : The path to the model. This function returns the model of an object. This can be done by passing a string for the object Id, or 0 can be passed to use the script's reference. Note The path returned does not include the Data Files\\models prefix. Get Model by Object ID begin Example_xGetModelById long model setx model to xGetModel \"ingred_bonemeal_01\" if ( model == 0 ) return endif xMessageFix \"Model: %s\" model MessageBox \"Model: ________________________________\" end Get Model by Reference begin Example_xGetModelByRef long ref long model setx ref to xGetPCTarget if ( ref == 0 ) return endif setx model to ref->xGetModel 0 if ( model == 0 ) return endif xMessageFix \"Model: %s\" model MessageBox \"Model: ________________________________\" end xGetName \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: string name : The reference's name, or 0 if no name was found. xGetName returns a string containing the name (suitable for display, not the objectid) for the object or 0 if the object doesn't have a name. The NPC who falls from the sky near Seyda Neen has an object id of \"agronian guy\" but his name is \"Tarhiel\" when you look at his corpse. xGetOwnerInfo \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: string owner : The object ID of the NPC or faction owner of the object. long or string condition : If owned by a faction, this is a long indicating the required rank. If this is an NPC this value is either 0, or a string for the global variable to check. long type : The Object Type of owner , either NPC or Faction. Ownership of entities in the world in Morrowind is comprised of two parts: owner and condition (this can specify when the player being detected taking or using the entity is not considered a crime). These work in two modes: The first is where owner is an NPC ID, and condition is a global variable - while the global var is set to a non-zero value, activating the entity is never considered a crime. In the second mode, owner is a faction id, and condition is a rank within it. If the player has equal (or higher) rank in that faction, then he can be seen using or taking the entity without it being a crime. This is how supply chests and beds in guildhalls work (their rank requirement is the minimal rank). This function allows getting full ownership information of an entity: both parts, whatever they may be (as well as what mode is used for the ownership). It is more in-depth than the xGetOwner function, which does not fully handle faction ownership or ownership with a global var requirement. Tip If the returned condition is a global variable, it can be used with xGetGlobal and xSetGlobal .

Returns the quality of reference's base object. Supports alchemy apparatus, lockpicks, probes, repair tools. xGetRef \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long objectID : An object ID to get a reference to, or 0 to get the script caller's reference. Returned: long reference : The reference requested, or 0 if none were found. Returns a reference to one of the active objects that match the object ID. An active object is an object in one of the loaded cells, or a persistent object such as an NPC. xGetStackSize \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: long stackSize : The amount of items in the stack, or 0 if not called on a reference. This function returns the stack size of a given reference. For example if used on a reference to iron arrows, xGetStackSize will tell you how many arrows there are in that stack. Get player target's stack size. begin Example_xGetStackSize long ref long size setx ref to xGetPCTarget if ( ref == 0 ) return endif setx size to ref->xGetStackSize if ( size > 1 ) MessageBox \"Target stack size is %g.\" size else MessageBox \"Target is a single item.\" endif end xGetTrap \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: string spellID : The trap's spell ID. string spellName : The trap's spell name. short spellCost : The trap's spell cost. Returns info about the reference's trap spell. Only works on container and doors. All returns will be zero if no trap is present. xGetValue \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: long Value : The total value or maximum capacity of the object. xGetValue returns the Value of reference's base object. xGetWeight \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: float weight : The total weight or maximum capacity of the object. xGetWeight returns the weight of reference's base object. If the reference is a stack of objects, return the total weight of the entire stack. If the reference is a container, return the maximum capacity. xMyCellID \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: string cellID : The reference's current cell ID. Returns a string containing the name of the cell the object (intended to be used with references to unique NPCs) inhabits. So fargoth_ref->xMyCellID would return \"Seyda Neen\" unless you've lured him into the wilderness for some reason. Useful for locating that missing companion. Can't locate items stored in containers or inventory. xMyRef \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: long reference : The caller's reference. Returns a reference to the calling object. Detect if target from local script. begin Example_xMyRef long myRef long targetRef setx targetRef to xGetPCTarget if ( targetRef == 0 ) return endif setx myRef to xMyRef if ( myRef == targetRef ) MessageBox \"I'm being targetted!\" endif end xPosition \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: float x : The X location to reposition to. float y : The Y location to reposition to. float z : The Z location to reposition to. float rotation : The rotation to take when positioned. Returned: None This is a wrapper for the vanilla Position function that can take variable input. xPositionCell \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: float x : The X location to reposition to. float y : The Y location to reposition to. float z : The Z location to reposition to. float rotation : The rotation to take when positioned. string cellID : The name/ID of the cell to position to. Returned: None This is a wrapper for the vanilla PositionCell function that can take variable input. xRefID \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: string id : The reference's ID. xRefID returns the reference's ID. In contrast to xGetBaseID , this function will include the hexadecimal suffix that identifies unique instances of containers, creatures, or NPCs. For example, where xRefID would return \"Fargoth00000000\" , xGetBaseID would instead return just \"Fargoth\" . xRefType \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: None Returned: long type : The Object Type of the reference. Returns the four byte object name of the calling reference. xRemoveItem \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string objectID : The object ID of the item to remove. long count : The number of items to remove. Returned: None This is a wrapper for the vanilla RemoveItem function that can take variable input. xSetCharge \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: float charge : New charge that will be set on the reference. Returned: long result : 1 if the reference's was modified, otherwise 0. Sets the current charge on a 'cast when used' or 'cast when strikes' enchanted item. May not work if the item has never been used. xSetCondition \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: float Condition : New condition that will be set on the reference. Returned: long result : 1 if the reference's was modified, otherwise 0. Sets the current condition of armor and weapons. Armor must not be at 100% or this function will fail. It must have already sustained some damage. xSetMaxCharge \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: float maxCharge : New charge that will be set on the reference. Returned: long result : 1 if the reference's was modified, otherwise 0. Sets the maximum charge on an enchanted item. xSetMaxCondition \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: float maxCondition : New maximum condition that will be set on the reference. Returned: long result : 1 if the reference's was modified, otherwise 0. Sets the maxium condition for armor and weapons and maximum uses for lockpicks, probes, and repair tools. xSetName \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string name : The new name to apply to the reference's base object. (Maximum 31 characters) Returned: None xSetName uses the value parameter to change the reference's name. The new name will not persist through restarts. xSetQuality \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: float quality : New quality that will be set on the reference's base object. Returned: long result : 1 if the reference's base object was modified, otherwise 0. xSetQuality modifies the quality of reference's base object. Supports alchemy apparatus, lockpicks, probes, repair tools. xSetRef \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: reference newReference : A reference to the use for future function calls. Returned: None xSetRef provides a way of calling object functions where the syntax does not allow it, changing the reference used in future function calls. xSetTrap \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string spellID : The spell ID to set as the trap, or 0 to unset a trap. Returned: short result : 1 if the reference's trap was modified, otherwise 0 . Sets a trap. Only works on containers or doors. In order to have a trap, a reference must also have a lock. For references without locks, call Lock 0 and Unlock prior to xSetTrap . Traps that are set this way do not persist through saving and loading. If a trap is removed its removal persists only if the object is activated or its lock is manipulated before saving. If you want to set a trap on a door/container, first check for an existing lock ( xGetLockLevel ). If no lock is already installed, use Lock 0 , Unlock to create the lock/trap object. Set the trap. To make sure the trap is persistent, manipulate the lock, but then put it back to its original state. In other words, if the lock is currently unlocked, lock it (use xGetLockLevel to determine the correct lock level) then unlock it. Do the reverse if it's currently unlocked. xSetValue \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long value : New value that will be set on the reference's base object. Returned: long result : 1 if the reference's base object was modified, otherwise 0. xSetValue modifies the value of reference's base object. xSetWeight \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: float weight : New weight that will be set on the reference's base object. Returned: long result : 1 if the reference's base object was modified, otherwise 0. xSetWeight modifies the weight of the reference's base object.","title":"Reference Functions"},{"location":"references/mwse-mwscript/reference/#reference-functions","text":"Warning The MWSE-mwscript API is deprecated.

Returned: string result : A string build from the combined input. xStringBuild returns a new string that is constructed based on the format string and any other variable values as needed. The format string is similar to those for MessageBox with % indicating some special character or variable substitution. Some patterns can be used to place special characters into the string: Token Meaning %% A single % sign is placed in the string. %n A new line marker (CR/LF) is placed in the string. %q A quotation mark (\") is placed in the string. The rest are used to insert values from the remaining parameters into the output string. Token Meaning %d A short or long value is inserted as a decimal integer. %h A short or long value is inserted as a hexadecimal integer. %f A float value is inserted as real decimal number. %s A string value is inserted. %l A long value is inserted as a four character string. Note The uppercase forms %N , %Q , %D , %H , %F , %S , and %L also work. The float specifier takes a precision specifier just like the MessageBox command.

Returned: string (many) matches : Results of the pattern matching for pattern on string . The function always return desiredMatches results. This function performs much as xStringMatch , but returns the result groups of the regex match. The a number of results matching desiredMatches is always returned. The matches will be 0 if a match isn't made. xStringCompare \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string leftString : The first string in the comparison. string rightString : The second string in the comparison. Returned: string result : 0 if the strings are equal, otherwise a signed number based on sorting. Compares the two strings based on alphabetical order and returns 0 if they are equal, a negative number if leftString would appear first, and a positive number if rightString would appear first. xStringLength \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string string : The string to take the length of.

The set can contain individual characters, or ranges of the form a-b, which matches all characters between a and b, including a and b. (For example, [A-Z] will match upper case letters.) If the character set begins with ^, then it will match any character except those in the character set. [[:name:]] Matches a single character from the pre-defined set name. \\character Matches the character; that is, removes the special meaning, if any, from character. (For example, \".\" matches any single character, but \".\" matches the period character.) \\d Match a digit (0-9). \\l Match a lower case letter (a-z). \\s Match whitespace (space, tab). \\u Match an upper case letter (A-Z). \\w Match a word (a string of letters, digits, and underscores) \\D Match anything but a digit. \\L Match anything but a lower case letter (a-z). \\S Match anything but whitespace (space, tab). \\U Match anything but an upper case letter (A-Z). \\W Match anything but a word. \\< Match the start of a word. \\> Match the end of a word. \\b Match the end or start of a word. \\B Match anything but the end or start of a word.

The documentation found here is for legacy purposes only. None of the following functions can be used directly from Lua. xGetGlobal \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string globalName : The name of the global. Returned: long found : 1 if the global was found, otherwise 0. float value : The value of the global. Returns the value of a global represented by globalName . xGetGSString \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long index : ID of the GMST to look up. Returned: string value : The GMST value at the given index . Fetches a GMST string by its given index and returns its value . xGetKeyBind \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long controlType : The Control Type _ desired. Returned: long scanCode : The Key Scan Code _ for the controlType . long scanDevice : The device type used for the associated scan code. A value of 0 is keyboard, 1 is mouse, 2 is joystick. long keyCode : The Virtual-Key Code for the controlType . If this value is 0, the scan code could not be converted to a key code. This function allows scripts to determine what keys are configured by the player. Typically the keyCode is passed to xKeyPressed to determine if it is pressed. Other functions that require a scan code would make use of scanCode . Determine if the Activation Key is Pressed Begin IsActivating long scanCode long scanDevice long keyCode ; Get input information for the Activate key. setx scanCode scanDevice keyCode to xGetKeyBind 5 ifx (keyCode) ; Activation key was successfully obtained, get its state. setx isPressed to xKeyPressed keyCode if (isPressed) MessageBox \"Activation key pressed!\" endif endif StopScript \"IsActivating\" End xGetMCPFeatureState \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long id : Identifier for the MCP feature. Returned: short state : 1 if the feature is enabled, 0 if it is disabled, or -1 if MWSE couldn't determine the MCP installation state. This function can be used to attempt to ensure that the user has the correct Morrowind Code Patch features enabled. Note The id parameter comes from mcpatch\\describe.json . For example, 137 matches with the Slowfall Overhaul component. Warning This functions depends on the user not deleting their mcpatch\\installed file. If the user doesn't have this file (because they deleted it or don't have the MCP installed), this function returns a value of -1 . Example begin DetectPickPocketOverhaul short state setx state to xGetMCPFeatureState 77 if (state) then MessageBox \"Pickpocket overhaul is enabled in MCP.\" endif end xKeyPressed \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long keyCode : The Virtual-Key Code to check for input. Returned: long (many) keyStatus : The status of keyCode if the parameter is non-zero. Otherwise it returns multiple times, with every key code pressed. Monitors the status of the keyboard (and mouse buttons). This can be similar to GetPCSneaking, but actually detects whether a particular key is really being pressed. If input parameter code is a Virtual-Key Code (between 1 and 254) the return value will indicate the status of that key. A non-zero value means the key is being pressed. If the input code is 0, then on each call, the function will return the key code for the key (or one of the keys) currently being pressed. Warning Some of the codes match different keys on different keyboard layouts. Note The key VK code for a given input can be fetched using xKeyPressed , instead of having to rely on hardcoded values. xLogMessage \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string format : The formatting for the log message. varies (many) input : Values to inject into the format . Returned: None Writes out formatted strings to the log file (mwse.log). This works much like MessageBox but with the additional formatting options described for xStringBuild . A trailing % in the format string will suppress the printing of the new line sequence allowing a single line of text to be created with two or more xLogMessage calls. The number of parameters specified in the format MUST match those supplied or there will be trouble. Note Literal strings in MWEdit have a maximum length of 63 characters. xMessageFix \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string (many) newStrings : The strings used to overwrite the following MessageBox call. Returned: None This function allows you to use strings from variables with the MessageBox function with a few restrictions. The MessageBox command must immediately follow this one. The number of strings for this function must match the number of strings for the MessageBox. The MessageBox can have buttons but it can't use variables. The values of the strings used on the MessageBox will be replaced with the values from xMessageFix, but the MessageBox strings set a maximum size for each of the xMessageFix strings (it's OK if the MessageBox strings are longer than the MessageFix ones). Using xMessageFix can take both the string variable and literal string types and each string acts as a format string as described for the xStringBuild function. If a string ends in a single % and the formatted string takes less space than the matching string from MessageBox, the remaining characters of the MessageBox string will be used. While it is possible to use formatted messages and buttons, it is best to format strings with xStringBuild if there are buttons involved because of the limit of 12 parameters per function. xScriptRunning \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string scriptName : The name of the script to determine the status of. Returned: long status : 1 if the script is running, or 0 if it is not (or does not exist). This function is a wrapper around ScriptRunning which allows a variable input. xSetGlobal \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string globalName : The name of the global. float value : The value to set the global to. Returned: long found : 1 if the global was set, otherwise 0. Set the global represented by globalName to value . xSetGSString \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: long index : ID of the GMST to look up. string newValue : The value to set the GMST to. Returned: long valueSet : 1 if the value was successfully set. Fetches a GMST string by its given index , and sets its value to newValue xStartScript \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string scriptName : The name of the script to determine the status of. Returned: None This function is a wrapper around StartScript which allows a variable input. xStopScript \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string scriptName : The name of the script to determine the status of. Returned: None This function is a wrapper around StartScript which allows a variable input. xTextInput \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string string : The string to modify with the user's input. long endCode : The Virtual-Key Code used to stop reading input. Returned: long length : The length of text . string text : The text entered. This function allows you to directly read keyboard input from the user and the results will be returned as a string. Pass a string and a virtual key code to the function. The function will wait for a key to be pressed and then take one of three actions. If the key pressed matches the endCode parameter, the string and its length are returned. If the key pressed is a printable ASCII character, the character is added to the string and the string and the number 0 are returned. If the key is RETURN or BACKSPACE, a new line is started or one character is removed from the string, and the modifed string and a 0 are returned. The function returns after each key press so that the current value of the string can be shown with xMessageFix and MessageBox but the string should only be used normally after the length is returned. Player controls should be disabled while this function is used. Note xGetKeyBind can be used to determine a specific key the user has configured. xTextInputAlt \u2693\ufe0e Parameters: string string : The string to modify with the user's input. long endCode : The Virtual-Key Code used to stop reading input. Returned: long length : The length of text . string text : The text entered. This function is identical to xTextInput except that the function simply checks the status of keys and returns immediately rather than waiting for a key to be pressed.","title":"Utility Functions"},{"location":"references/mwse-mwscript/utility/#utility-functions","text":"Warning The MWSE-mwscript API is deprecated.

Moon move in an arc shape along the sky. The arc's start is at in-game North and ends in the South. The arc's plane can be rotated from North-South axis, by axisOffset property. If moons overlap, Secunda is always rendered in front of Masser, so the Masser is covered by Secunda. Each moon has 8 phases, which differ by the amount of the moon that is visible and the part covered in black. During waxing the moon appears in the sky during the first part of the night, before midnight. After the full phase, the moons usually rise during the later part of the night, after midnight. Much like the Earth's moon. Absolutely the first moment the moon can appear is controlled by fadeInStart property, while the latest moment the moon sets is controlled by fadeOutFinish property.

If nil , deactivates behaviour associated with this property. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0 . Sets the element's positionX to a point relative to the parent element. A value of 0.0 is equal to the parent element's left content edge, whereas a value of 1.0 is equal to the parent element's right content edge. The positioning is absolute, which frees the element from the standard flow layout and allows overlapping elements. Incompatible with and will change the value of ignoreLayoutX . Elements may not respond to widthProportional sizing after this property is set. If you need to use both you should consider testing if it works first. Returns : result (number) absolutePosAlignY \u2693\ufe0e The vertical alignment of the element relative to it's parent element. Can be nil . If nil , deactivates behaviour associated with this property. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0 . Sets the element's positionY to a point relative to the parent element. A value of 0.0 is equal to the parent element's top content edge, whereas a value of 1.0 is equal to the parent element's bottom content edge. The positioning is absolute, which frees the element from the standard flow layout and allows overlapping elements. Incompatible with and will change the value of ignoreLayoutY . Elements may not respond to heightProportional sizing after this property is set. If you need to use both you should consider testing if it works first. Returns : result (number) alpha \u2693\ufe0e The element's alpha color. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0 . Used to composite elements. If you wish to hide an element completely, use disable instead. Returns : result (number) autoHeight \u2693\ufe0e If true , automatically expands element dimensions to fit child elements.

Some widgets like ScrollPanes are built of multiple layers of elements. When an element is created in a complex widget, it is automatically placed as a child of a content element, but other functions do not access this content element directly. This function finds this content container for any element, so that changing layout and accessing children is possible. For simple elements, the calling element will be returned so that there is always a valid container element. local result = myObject : getContentElement () Returns : result ( tes3uiElement ) getLuaData \u2693\ufe0e Gets an arbitrary lua value from the UI element.

Returns : value (boolean): The value of the property, defaulting to false if the property was not set. getPropertyCallback \u2693\ufe0e Properties are extra variables attached to an element. Morrowind uses these to bind variables to the UI, and they can be useful for element class-specific properties. This function gets a property as a number value, defaulting to 0 if the property was not set. This function can be dangerous to use, and can lead to crashes if not properly understood. local value = myObject : getPropertyCallback ( property ) Parameters : property (number, string): The property to get. Returns : value (number): The value of the property, defaulting to 0 if the property was not set. getPropertyFloat \u2693\ufe0e Properties are extra variables attached to an element.

The casting of the property to get. Returns : value (number): The value of the property, defaulting to nil if the property was not set. getPropertyProperty \u2693\ufe0e Properties are extra variables attached to an element. Morrowind uses these to bind variables to the UI, and they can be useful for element class-specific properties. This function gets a property whose value is, itself, a property, defaulting to 0 if the property was not set. local value = myObject : getPropertyProperty ( property ) Parameters : property (number, string): The property to get. Returns : value (number): The value of the property, defaulting to 0 if the property was not set. getTopLevelMenu \u2693\ufe0e Finds the parent menu containing the element.

This may only be called on top-level parents. myObject : loadMenuPosition () move \u2693\ufe0e Copies this element to a new parent, then destroys this element. This function can have unintended consequences. The specifics of what exact elements are being copied is important. local copy = myObject : move ( to ) Parameters : to ( tes3uiElement ): Where to create the copy. Returns : copy ( tes3uiElement ): The created copy. register \u2693\ufe0e Sets an event handler, which can add or override an existing event handler. The use of registerBefore or registerAfter is recommended if you do not want to replace the existing event handler. The eventID can be a standard event name, or an event specific to an element class. These can be accessed through tes3.uiEvent for convenience. The callback receives an argument with the event data. See below for details. The original Morrowind callback is captured and can be invoked with the forwardEvent method on the event argument. If there is an existing Lua callback, it is replaced. Standard events: **mouseLeave** Mouse cursor moving outside an element. Triggers once. **mouseOver** Mouse cursor moving over an element. Triggers once. **mouseDown** Left mouse button down over an element. **mouseClick** Left mouse button up over an element, after a mouseDown over the element. **mouseScrollUp** .. **mouseScrollDown** Mouse wheel scrolling. **mouseDoubleClick** Standard double-click. **mouseStillIdle** Mouse cursor positioned outside an element. Triggers every frame. **mouseStillOver** Mouse cursor positioned over an element. Triggers every frame. **mouseStillPressed** Mouse cursor positioned over an element, after a mouseDown over the element. Triggers every frame. **mouseStillPressedOutside** Apparently not working in the engine. Mouse cursor positioned outside an element, after a mouseDown over the element. Triggers every frame. **mouseRelease** Left mouse button up over an element. **keyPress** A raw key press. **keyEnter** The Return key is pressed. **help** On mouseover, but also marking the element as having a tooltip. Create a tooltip within the callback using the `tes3ui.createTooltipMenu` function. **focus** When a menu is clicked on, and moved on top of other menus. **unfocus** Just before another menu is clicked on, or a widget in that menu receives an event, or when the menu mode is toggled off. You may return false from this event to prevent the menu from being deselected, and to prevent leaving menu mode. **preUpdate** Before the menu layout is updated. **update** After the menu layout is updated. **destroy** When the UI element is destroyed, before any data or children are destroyed. Widget-specific events: Slider: **PartScrollBar_changed** Triggers on value change; moving the slider is not enough if the value is the same. Event forwarding \u2693\ufe0e The original Morrowind event handler is saved when you first register an event. It may be optionally invoked with the forwardEvent method. Note that handler may or may not destroy the event widget or the menu, so you should know how it behaves before accessing any elements after a callback. Example local function onClick(e) -- pre-event code e.source:forwardEvent(e) -- post-event code end local button = menu:findChild(\"MenuExample_Ok\") button:register(\"mouseClick\", onClick) Event handler \u2693\ufe0e The standard type signature for events. `boolean`_ eventHandler(**EventData** e) Returns: `optional` Returning `false` may cancel an interaction for certain events. e.g. unfocus EventData: **source** (`Element`_) The source element of the event. **id** (`number`_) The numeric id of the event type. **widget** (`Element`_) The widget element that the source belongs to, if the element is a sub-part of a widget. May not be accurate if the element is not a sub-part. **data0** (`number`_) .. **data1** (`number`_) Event-specific raw data values. For mouse events, these are the screen X and Y coordinates of the pointer. For keyboard events, data0 is the `scan code`_. **relativeX** (`number`_) .. **relativeY** (`number`_) For mouse events only. X and Y coordinates of the pointer relative to the top-left of the element. myObject : register ( eventID , callback ) Parameters : eventID (string): The event id. Maps to values in tes3.uiEvent . callback (function): The callback function. registerAfter \u2693\ufe0e Sets an event handler to run after any existing event handler on the element.

Can be any event usable with register . The callback receives an argument with the event data. See register for details. myObject : registerBefore ( eventID , callback ) Parameters : eventID (string): The event id. callback (function): The callback function. reorderChildren \u2693\ufe0e Moves the layout order of the children of this element. `count` elements are taken from starting child `Element`_ or index (0-based) `moveFrom`, and moved before the child `Element`_ or index (0-based) `insertBefore`. If `count` is -1, all children after `moveFrom` are moved. If any index is a negative number, then the index represents a distance from the end of the child list. Returns `true` if the operation succeeded, or `false` if at least one argument was invalid. local result = myObject : reorderChildren ( insertBefore , moveFrom , count ) Parameters : insertBefore ( tes3uiElement , number): The insertion point (or its 0-based child index). moveFrom ( tes3uiElement , number): The first child (or 0-based child index) to be moved. count (number): The number of child elements to move.
